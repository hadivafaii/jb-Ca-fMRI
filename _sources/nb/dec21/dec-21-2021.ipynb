    "## Origin of Ca$^{2+}$ signal\n",
    "\n",
    "Where does the mesoscopic Ca$^{2+}$ signal come from?  What are the main contributors to its variance? Addressing these questions is useful for a well-informed ROI definition. More broadly, and perhaps more importantly, having a better understanding of this is cruicial for correct interpration of results. I did a literature review and here is what I found.  I will summarize the most important things I learned from these papers and also put a link for future reference.  Next, I will use these information to propose a particular way of defining layers for each colum.  Finally, I will speculate a little bit about what to expect from results and how to interpret them."

    "## Defining ROIs that make sense\n",
    "\n",
    "So far I've gathered evidence that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calcium signal is coming from neruopil in superficial layers\n",
    "- Cell bodies from layers 2/3 and 5 contribute to this neuropil\n",
    "- High and reliable correlation between somatic and dendritic activity of layer 5 neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, comparing Ca$^{2+}$ and BOLD results should not be limited only to the surface ROIs that appear in the optical space after transformation.  Based on what is known about the origin of these signals, I propose the following approach to ROI definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "![null](../../_extras/fig_sketches/Columnar.png \"Columnar ROI definition\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We parcellate the cortical surface into spatially homogenous and roughly equal-sized ROIs.\n",
    "2. In the depth dimension, we follow paths (or streamlines) normal to each plane.  This will roughly correspond to the way cortical columns are organized.\n",
    "3. For each column, we combine layers 1, 2/3, and 4 into a single ROI (call it superficial layer). Layer 5 is its own ROI (call it intermediate layer), and layers 6a and b become another layer (call it deep layer).  Therefore, each column contributes with 3 ROIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(*Previously, I was dividing each column into several chunks with equal thickness, but this new approach makes much more sense.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we gain from this\n",
    "Such ROIs will allows us to compare superficial, intermediate, and deep layers in BOLD to the superficial only Ca$^{2+}$.  I anticipate to find the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **superficial** and **intermediate** layers: similar correspondence between BOLD and Ca$^{2+}$.\n",
    "- For the **deep** layer: slightly reduced similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge here is that there will be some amount of mixing between signals coming from ROIs at the bounadries.  With an ppropriate number of columns this problem can be remedied, but we can't completely get rid of this.  Unless we build a next level parcellation algorithm that somehow uses curvature of cortex in the initial parcellation of the dorsal flatmap.  I think this isn't too much of a problem to be worth the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key argument here is that the neruopil signal has contributions coming from deep layer 5 neurons. It is therefore crucial to keep track of things in a columnar way.  For instance, defining ROIs by going along the superior-inferior dimension might sound more intuitive at first, but it's not ideal since we lose track of the columns in that case:\n",

    "## Interpreting results\n",
    "\n",
    "Flouroscence activity recorded in wide-field Ca$^{2+}$ experiments is representative of what's going on in the respective columns.  But to what extent?  We know that the variance in this signal is dominated by neuropil activity in layer 1 to a large extent, and layer 2/3 to some extent.  Neuropil activity, on the other hand, contains information about somatic activity in layer 5.  What about layer 6?  These are questions that we might be able to contribute to.  Although, what we find will need to be later validated by asking this question directly at the time series level (i.e. predict dynamics of one modality using the other), but this is still a good start.  We can ask simple questions such as do we find similar large-scale organization for the entire column?  What differences/similarities do we observe in the two modalities when we compare different layers?  What about averaging all layers then comparing to Ca$^{2+}$? Does that increase/decrease correspondence? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, given the evidence I've presented here, I am convincend that this way of defining ROIs is both conceptually sound and practical."
